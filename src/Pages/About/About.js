            <p>
                WE HELP PUT DINNER ON THE TABLE. We are we, not I or they. We are members. We are owners. We are parents, siblings, grandparents and cousins. We see the opportunity in supporting one another. And all those within our communities. WE ARE FAMILY. Our reverence fuels the future. We are adaptable. We love what we do. We work hard with others. We know quality matters. We know local matters. We revitalize the connection to our food sources. WE BELIEVE IN A BETTER TOMORROW. We are your local grocery stores working together. We are on time. We are timeless. WE ARE MANY MEMBERS. We are one force. We are one vision.
                We are building a better world. Now. Together.</p>
